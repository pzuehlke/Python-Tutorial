    "\n",
    "One of the most common tasks dealt with in the context of programming is that of automatically performing similar actions multiple times. Constructs which allow the solution to this problem are usually called __loops__. The iterations in a loop are frequently performed by running through the elements of a list, tuple or string in order. However, any object capable of returning its members one at a time can be used; such an object is said to be __iterable__.\n",
    "\n",
    "For example, one might wish to separately consider each number between $ 1 $ and $ 1\\,000\\,000 $ and test whether it is prime, performing an action (such as appending it to a list of primes) if that is the case. As another example, a bank may need to run daily through its record of clients and to send a warning message to those clients whose balance became negative on the previous day.\n",
    "\n",
    "In order to run through all elements of an iterable type, Python provides the `for` keyword.\n",
