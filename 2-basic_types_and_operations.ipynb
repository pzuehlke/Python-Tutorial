    "## $ \\S 1 $ Objects, classes, values, variables and assignment\n",
    "\n",
    "### $ 1.1 $ Basic terminology of object-oriented programming\n",
    "\n",
    "A __class__ (or _data type_) consists of a set of values and a set of\n",
    "permissible operations on these values. When a class is already built into\n",
    "Python, it is usually called a __type__.  For example, in Python there are types\n",
    "for the representation of integers, real numbers, text strings and booleans,\n",
    "among others. \n",
    "\n",
    "For example, an integer can take on the value $ -3 $, but not the value $ 3.14\n",
    "$. Booleans can only take on two values: `True` or `False`.  Similarly, we can\n",
    "multiply two real numbers, but not one string by another; we can concatenate\n",
    "two strings, but that doesn't make sense for boolean values.\n",
    "\n",
    "The integer $ -3 $ is an _object_ belonging to the class of integers. More\n",
    "generally, in programming, an __object__ is an aggregate abstraction of some\n",
    "data. For example, we may choose to represent a car in Python by a set of values\n",
    "such as its manufacturer (a string), model (also a string), its year of\n",
    "manufacture (an integer), its color, its identification number, etc., all\n",
    "encapsulated as a unit. Concretely, an object is just an instance of a specific\n",
    "class residing in memory. In Python, everything is represented is an object,\n",
    "and every object must belong to a class.\n",
    "\n",
    "As another example, if we had to write software for a banking system, it would in\n",
    "principle be possible to work only with built-in types. However, this would be\n",
    "extremely cumbersome. In order to encapsulate the data and behavior associated\n",
    "with the manipulation of bank accounts at a higher level of abstraction, we\n",
    "should design and implement an appropriate class ourselves, using built-in types\n",
    "and other previously existing classes and operations as building blocks. Each\n",
    "bank account in our system would then be an object belonging to, or an instance\n",
    "of, this class.\n",
    "\n",
    "üìù In the terminology of object-oriented programming, the technical terms for\n",
    "\"property\" and \"operation\" are _attribute_ and _method_, respectively. Thus,\n",
    "the purpose of a class is to implement a specific set of attributes and\n",
    "methods to be inherited by every object (instance) of that class. The collection\n",
    "of values assumed by all the attributes of an object is called its _state_.\n",
    "\n",
    "In the example of the bank account class, two of the attributes could be\n",
    "the current balance and the account holder's ID. There would probably be\n",
    "methods designed to model deposits, withdrawals, transfers, modifications in\n",
    "the holder's address, etc. \n",
    "\n",
    "In this tutorial we will not need to discuss objects, classes and object-oriented\n",
    "programming beyond what has already been mentioned. In fact, we will work only\n",
    "with built-in types.\n",
    "\n",
    "### $ 1. 2 $ Variables\n",
    "\n",
    "Each object created by the Python interpreter is assigned a unique memory\n",
    "address that we never need to handle directly or worry about. That is because\n",
    "this address is abstracted away through the use of _variables_.  A __variable__\n",
    "is an association of an __identifier__ (i.e., name or label) with an object.\n",
    "In Python, variables are created through an __assignment__ statement, using the\n",
    "__assignment operator__ `=` in the form _\\<identifier>_ `=` _\\<object>_.  This\n",
    "binds the identifier to the left of the `=` sign to the object to its right."
