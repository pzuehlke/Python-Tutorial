    "can be applied to it. Each object that is created by the Python interpreter \n",
    "is assigned a unique internal identifier (which we do not need to handle\n",
    "directly or worry about). The actual content or data that an object represents\n",
    "is called its __value__.\n",

    "When a class is already built into Python, it is usually called a __type__. For\n",
    "example, there are types for the representation of integers, text strings or\n",
