    "\n",
    "### $ 1.1 $ What is a procedure/function?\n",
    "\n",
    "In the context of programming languages, a __procedure__ is a collection of\n",
    "instructions to be performed by the computer to accomplish a given task,\n",
    "packaged as a unit. Procedures are also called __functions__ or __(sub)routines__.\n",
    "\n",
    "__Examples:__ We may implement procedures to perform the following tasks:\n",
    "* Take a positive real number (more precisely, a floating-point number) as\n",
    "  argument and return an approximation to its square root.\n",
    "* Take a positive integer as input and decide whether it is prime.\n",
    "* Take two strings, representing a person's bank account ID and password,\n",
    "  and a float, representing an amount to be withdrawn from that account,\n",
    "  and if the password matches that associated with the client's\n",
    "  as stored in a database, decrement the client's balance by that amount.\n",
    "* Take a square matrix and return its inverse if it exists or raise an error\n",
    "  otherwise.\n",
    "* Simulate $ 1\\,000 $ dice rolls and display the results in the form of a\n",
    "  histogram.\n",
    "* Take a list of points in the plane and plot them all together with the line\n",
    "  that best fits them.\n",
    "\n",
    "The term \"procedure\" may provide a clearer understanding of the concept than\n",
    "\"function\", which evokes comparisons with the traditional functions found\n",
    "in mathematics (e.g., real functions of a real variable). However, the notion of\n",
    "a procedure is more general. The difference stems from the fact that a\n",
    "procedure in Python and most other languages can interact with and modify\n",
    "objects outside of its scope. Procedures exhibiting this behavior are said to\n",
    "have __side effects__. For instance, the most fitting mathematical\n",
    "representation of a procedure that takes no input and returns no output would be\n",
    "the (unique) function from the empty set to the empty set. In contrast, in\n",
    "Python, there are *infinitely many* such procedures, such as those that print a\n",
    "message or a random number to the screen, modify the value of a global variable,\n",
    "enter an infinite loop, take input from the user, write to a file, raise an\n",
    "error, and so on. Each of these procedures alters the state of the program, even\n",
    "though they take no input and produce no output. It is also worth noting that\n",
    "while mathematical functions consistently yield the same result when applied to\n",
    "the same arguments, this may not be true for a procedure with side effects.\n",
    "Regrettably, despite the potential ambiguity that the term \"function\" may\n",
    "cause in this context, its use is widespread.\n",
    "\n",
    "📝 In the __functional programming (FP)__ paradigm, programs are structured as a\n",
    "series of function definitions, with tasks being accomplished through their\n",
    "composition. As a best practice, each function should ideally perform a single\n",
    "task. An important design principle in this context is\n",
    "the use of __abstraction barriers__: one should be able to use a function\n",
    "without knowing its implementation details. That is, programs should be\n",
    "organized so that the only relevant information for using a given function is\n",
    "its required input and corresponding output, rather than _how_ this output is\n",
    "obtained. In particular, functions having side effects should be avoided, or at\n",
    "least restricted to the edges of the program. The absence of side effects\n",
    "simplifies the task of verifying that a program operates as intended."
