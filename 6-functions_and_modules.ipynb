    "### $ 1.1 $ What is a procedure/function?\n",
    "\n",
    "In the context of programming languages, a __procedure__ is a collection of\n",
    "instructions to be performed by the computer to accomplish a given task,\n",
    "packaged as a unit. Procedures are also called __functions__ or __subroutines__.\n",
    "\n",
    "__Examples:__ We may implement procedures to perform the following tasks:\n",
    "* Take a positive real number (more precisely, a floating-point number) as\n",
    "  argument and return an approximation to its square root;\n",
    "* Take a positive integer as input and decide whether it is prime;\n",
    "* Take two strings (representing a person's bank account ID and password)\n",
    "  and a float (representing an amount to be deposited in that account) as\n",
    "  arguments and, if the password matches that associated with the client's\n",
    "  as stored in a database, decrements the client's balance by that amount.\n",
    "* Take a matrix having, say, complex entries, and return its inverse (if it\n",
    "  exists);\n",
    "* Simulate $ 1000 $ dice rolls and display the results in the form of a\n",
    "  histogram;\n",
    "* Take a list of points in the plane and find the line that best fits\n",
    "  them.\n",
    "\n",
    "The name \"procedure\" provides a better idea of the concept. The word\n",
    "\"function\" may evoke comparison with the usual functions considered in\n",
    "Mathematics (e.g., real functions of a real variable). However, the notion of a\n",
    "procedure is more general. The difference stems from the fact that a procedure\n",
    "(in Python, but also in most other languages) can rely on and modify objects\n",
    "outside of its scope. Procedures that exhibit this behavior are said to have\n",
    "__side effects__. For example, the most adequate mathematical representation of\n",
    "a procedure that takes no input and returns no output would be the (unique)\n",
    "function from the empty set to the empty set. However, in Python there are\n",
    "_infinitely many_ such procedures, such as one that prints a message or random\n",
    "number to the screen, modifies the value of a global variable, enters an\n",
    "infinite loop, takes input from the user, writes to a file, raises an error,\n",
    "etc.. Each of these functions modifies the state of the program even though they\n",
    "take no input and produce no output. Note also that while mathematical functions\n",
    "always yield the same result when applied to the same arguments, this may not\n",
    "be true of a procedure that has side effects. Unfortunately, despite the\n",
    "ambiguity that this term may cause, the use of the word \"function\" as a synonym\n",
    "for \"procedure\" is widespread.\n",
    "\n",
    "📝 In the __functional programming (FP)__ paradigm, programs are organized by a\n",
    "sequence of function definitions, and tasks are accomplished by composing them.\n",
    "In particular, as a best practice, each function should perform a single task.\n",
    "An important design principle in this context is that of an\n",
    "__abstraction barrier__: One should be able to use a function even while\n",
    "ignoring its implementation details. That is, programs should be organized in\n",
    "such a way that, in order to use a given function, the only relevant information\n",
    "should be what input it requires and what the corresponding output will be, but\n",
    "not _how_ this output is obtained. In particular, functions having side effects\n",
    "should be avoided, or at least moved to the edges of the program. The lack of\n",
    "side effects makes it much easier to verify that a program runs as expected and\n",
    "to analyze its behavior."

    "To avoid having to refer to the name of the module every time one of its functions/objects is called, we have two options:\n",
    "1. Explicitly import the functions/objects $ f_1, f_2, \\dots, f_n $ through the statement\n",

    "\n",
    "⚠️ Both methods may lead to conflicts with definitions loaded from other modules (or from core Python). For example, both modules _math_ and _NumPy_ provide implementations of the sine function as `sin`; if both are loaded using the syntax in 1 or 2,  then `sin` will take the definition of whichever module was loaded last. Moreover, the second method is also wasteful since it will load several objects that will probably not be used."
