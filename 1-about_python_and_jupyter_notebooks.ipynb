    "[__Python__](https://www.python.org/) is a high-level modern programming\n",
    "language originally developed by [Guido van\n",
    "Rossum](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Guido_van_Rossum) starting in 1989. It is\n",
    "at its core an [object-oriented\n",
    "programming](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Object-oriented_programming) (_OOP_)\n",
    "language. However, it also supports the main elements of [functional\n",

    "\n",
    "In contrast to some other widely used languages such as C, Java or Fortran,\n",
    "Python is an __interpreted__ language, meaning that its scripts are not\n",
    "compiled, but rather run by an interpreter.  An __interpreter__ is a program\n",
    "that directly reads and interprets each instruction line by line in the source\n",
    "code and executes it immediately. In contrast, a __compiler__ takes the code as\n",
    "a whole and converts all of it into assembly or machine language to produce a\n",
    "standalone executable file.\n",
    "\n",
    "The main advantage of interpreted languages is that they facilitate debugging\n",
    "and testing, since it is unnecessary to recompile, link and execute the source\n",
    "code after each modification. On the other hand, programs written in interpreted\n",
    "languages tend to have much slower execution time than their compiled\n",
    "equivalents, sometimes by a factor of ten or even more, because by looking at\n",
    "the entire code at once a compiler can optimize or simplify several operations.\n",
    "\n",
    "The main features of Python that make it suitable for teaching and learning\n",
    "about programming are:\n",
    "\n",
    "✅ Python is _free_ and _open source_ software (_FOSS_);  \n",
    "✅ Python is available for all major operating systems, easy to install and its\n",
    "programs are platform-independent;  \n",
    "✅ Python's syntax is simple and pleasant, which makes it legible and easy to\n",
    "learn;  \n",
    "✅ Python has an extensive standard library, abundant extensions and a large\n",
    "community of users and developers;  \n",
    "✅ Python abstracts away many low-level details, making it easier to focus on the\n",
    "problems that need to be solved instead of on technical details.\n"
