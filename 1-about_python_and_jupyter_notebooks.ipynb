    "Python is an __interpreted__ language, meaning that its scripts are not\n",
    "compiled, but rather run by an interpreter.  An __interpreter__ is a program\n",
    "that directly reads and interprets each instruction line by line in the source\n",

    "The main advantage of interpreted languages is that they facilitate debugging\n",
    "and testing, since it is unnecessary to recompile, link and execute the source\n",
    "code after each modification. On the other hand, programs written in interpreted\n",
    "languages tend to have much slower execution time than their compiled\n",
    "equivalents, sometimes by a factor of ten or more, because by looking at\n",
    "the entire code at once, a compiler can optimize or simplify several operations.\n",

    "The main features of Python that make it suitable for teaching and learning\n",

    "‚úÖ Python is _free_ and _open source_ software (_FOSS_);  \n",

    "‚úÖ Python is available for all major operating systems and its programs are\n",
    "platform-independent;  \n",
    "‚úÖ Python has an extensive standard library, abundant extensions and a large\n",
    "community of users and developers;  \n",
